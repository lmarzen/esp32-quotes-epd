# ESP32 E-Paper Quote Display

Display motivational quotes on a 7.5in E-Paper (aka E-ink) display. Powered by a wifi-enabled, low-power ESP32 microcontroller. Quotes are retrieved from a Google spreadsheet, allowing for quick and easy management of your collection of inspiring quotes.

The project draws ~14μA when sleeping and an estimated average of ~83mA during its ~15s wake period. The display can be configured to update as frequently as desired. When the refresh interval is set to 60 minutes, the device will run for >1 year on a single 5000mAh battery. A smaller battery will last many years if you only desire a daily quote. The project displays accurate battery life percentage and can be recharged via a USB-C cable connected to a wall adapter or computer.

This project is an adaptation of my open-source e-paper weather display project (https://github.com/lmarzen/esp32-weather-epd).

I made a small stand by hollowing out a piece of wood from the bottom. On the back, I used a short USB extension cable so that I can charge the battery without needing to remove the components from the stand. I also wired a small reset button to refresh the display manually. Additionally, I 3d printed a cover for the bottom, which is held on by magnets. The E-paper screen is very thin, so I used a thin piece of acrylic to support it.

## Features

Quotes are managed through a google spreadsheet.

The reset button can be used to manually cycle to the next quote.

Multiple quote selection options,

- Random - Choose a quote completely at random.
- Shuffle - Displays each quote once before shuffling them.
- Iterative - Loops through the quotes in order.

Quotes are automatically scaled to fit the screen optimally.

Alignment and font for quotes and authors can be controlled independently.

Support for multiple fonts, I have included a number of open-source fonts. If you want to add more, see [fonts/README](fonts/README).

Use different fonts depending on the length of the quote, or use the same font all around. Up to you!

Here are a handful of examples:

## Setup Guide

### Hardware

7.5inch (800×480) E-Ink Display w/ HAT for Raspberry Pi, SPI interface

- Advantages of E-Paper
  - Ultra Low Power Consumption - E-Paper (or E-Ink) displays are ideal for low-power applications that do not require frequent display refreshes. E-Paper displays only draw power when refreshing the display and do not have a backlight. Images will remain on the screen even when power is removed.

- Limitations of E-Paper:
  - Colors - E-Paper has traditionally been limited to just black and white, but in recent years 3-color E-Paper screens have started showing up.

  - Refresh Times and Ghosting - E-Paper displays are highly susceptible to ghosting effects if refreshed too quickly. To avoid this, E-Paper displays often take a few seconds to refresh(4s for the unit used in this project) and will alternate between black and white a few times, which can be distracting.

- Note that this project also now supports this 3-color panel as well. Some elements will be drawn with an accent color, at the cost of a longer refresh sequence. https://www.waveshare.com/product/7.5inch-e-paper-hat-b.htm (800x480, 7.5inch E-Ink display, Red/Black/White)


FireBeetle 2 ESP32-E Microcontroller

- Why the ESP32?

  - Onboard WiFi.

  - 520kB of RAM and 4MB of FLASH, enough to store lots of fonts.

  - Low power consumption.

  - Small size, many small development boards available.

- Why the FireBeetle 2 ESP32-E

  - Drobot's FireBeetle ESP32 models are optimized for low-power consumption (https://diyi0t.com/reduce-the-esp32-power-consumption/). The Drobot's FireBeetle 2 ESP32-E variant offers USB-C, but older versions of the board with Mirco-USB would work fine too.

  - Firebeelte ESP32 models include onboard charging circuitry for a 3.7v lithium-ion(LiPo) battery.

  - FireBeetle ESP32 models include onboard circuitry to monitor battery voltage of a battery connected to its JST-PH2.0 connector.


- https://www.dfrobot.com/product-2195.html


3.7V Lipo Battery w/ 2 Pin JST Connector


- Size is up to you. I used a 10000mah battery so that the device can operate on a single charge for >1 year.


- The battery can be charged by plugging the FireBeetle ESP32 into the wall via the USB-C connector while the battery is plugged into the ESP32's JST connector.

  > **Warning**
  > The polarity of JST-PH2.0 connectors is not standardized! You may need to swap the order of the wires in the connector.


### Wiring

Pin connections are defined in config.cpp.

If you are using the FireBeetle 2 ESP32-E, you can use the connections I used or change them how you would like.

IMPORTANT: The E-Paper Driver Hat has two physical switches that MUST be set correctly for the display to work.

- Display Config: Set switch to position B.

- Interface Config: Set switch to position 0.

Cut the low power pad for even longer battery life.

- From https://wiki.dfrobot.com/FireBeetle_Board_ESP32_E_SKU_DFR0654

  > Low Power Pad: This pad is specially designed for low power consumption. It is connected by default. You can cut off the thin wire in the middle with a knife to disconnect it. After disconnection, the static power consumption can be reduced by 500 μA. The power consumption can be reduced to 13 μA after controlling the maincontroller enter the sleep mode through the program. Note: when the pad is disconnected, you can only drive RGB LED light via the USB Power supply.

### Configuration, Compilation, and Upload

PlatformIO for VSCode is used for managing dependencies, code compilation, and uploading to ESP32.

1. Clone this repository or download and extract the .zip.

2. Install VSCode.

3. Follow these instructions to install the PlatformIO extension for VSCode: https://platformio.org/install/ide?install=vscode

4. Open the project in VSCode.

   a. File > Open Folder...

   b. Navigate to this project and select the folder called "platformio".

5. Configure Options.

   - Most configuration options are located in [config.cpp](platformio/src/config.cpp), with a few  in [config.h](platformio/include/config.h). Locale/language options can also be found in locales/locale_**.cpp.

   - Important settings to configure in config.cpp:

     - WiFi credentials (ssid, password).

     - Open Weather Map API key (it's free, see next section for important notes about obtaining an API key).

     - Latitude and longitude.

     - Time and date formats.

     - Sleep duration.

     - Pin connections for E-Paper (SPI), BME280 (I2C), and battery voltage (ADC).

   - Important settings to configure in config.h:

     - Units (Metric or Imperial).

   - Comments explain each option in detail.

6. Build and Upload Code.

   a. Connect ESP32 to your computer via USB.

   b. Click the upload arrow along the bottom of the VSCode window. (Should say "PlatformIO: Upload" if you hover over it.)

      - PlatformIO will automatically download the required third-party libraries, compile, and upload the code. :)

      - You will only see this if you have the PlatformIO extension installed.

      - If you are getting errors during the upload process, you may need to install drivers to allow you to upload code to the ESP32.

### OpenWeatherMap API Key

Sign up here to get an API key; it's free. https://openweathermap.org/api

This project will make calls to 2 different APIs ("One Call" and "Air Pollution").

> **Note**
> OpenWeatherMap One Call 2.5 API has been deprecated for all new free users (accounts created after Summer 2022). Fortunately, you can make 1,000 calls/day to the One Call 3.0 API for free by following the steps below.

- If you have an account created before Summer 2022, you can simply use the One Call 2.5 API by setting `OWM_ONECALL_VERSION = "2.5";` in config.cpp.

- Otherwise, the One Call API 3.0 is only included in the "One Call by Call" subscription. This separate subscription includes 1,000 calls/day for free and allows you to pay only for the number of API calls made to this product.

Here's how to subscribe and avoid any credit card changes:
   - Go to https://home.openweathermap.org/subscriptions/billing_info/onecall_30/base?key=base&service=onecall_30
   - Follow the instructions to complete the subscription.
   - Go to https://home.openweathermap.org/subscriptions and set the "Calls per day (no more than)" to 1,000. This ensures you will never overrun the free calls.

## Error Messages and Troubleshooting

### Low Battery
<img src="showcase/demo-error-low-battery.jpg" align="left" width="25%" />
This error screen appears once the battery voltage has fallen below LOW_BATTERY_VOLTAGE (default = 3.20v). The display will not refresh again until it detects battery voltage above LOW_BATTERY_VOLTAGE. When battery voltage is between LOW_BATTERY_VOLTAGE and VERY_LOW_BATTERY_VOLTAGE (default = 3.10v) the esp32 will deep-sleep for periods of LOW_BATTERY_SLEEP_INTERVAL (default = 30min) before checking battery voltage again. If the battery voltage falls between LOW_BATTERY_SLEEP_INTERVAL and CRIT_LOW_BATTERY_VOLTAGE (default = 3.00v), then the display will deep-sleep for periods VERY_LOW_BATTERY_SLEEP_INTERVAL (default = 120min). If battery voltage falls below CRIT_LOW_BATTERY_VOLTAGE, then the esp32 will enter hibernate mode and will require a manual push of the reset (RST) button to begin updating again.

<br clear="left"/>

### WiFi Connection
<img src="showcase/demo-error-wifi.jpg" align="left" width="25%" />
This error screen appears when the ESP32 fails to connect to WiFi. If the message reads "WiFi Connection Failed" this might indicate an incorrect password. If the message reads "SSID Not Available" this might indicate that you mistyped the SSID or that the esp32 is out of the range of the access point. The esp32 will retry once every SLEEP_DURATION (default = 30min).

<br clear="left"/>

### API Error
<img src="showcase/demo-error-api.jpg" align="left" width="25%" />
This error screen appears if an error (client or server) occurs when making an API request to OpenWeatherMap. The second line will give the error code followed by a descriptor phrase. Positive error codes correspond to HTTP response status codes, while error codes <= 0 indicate a client(esp32) error. The esp32 will retry once every SLEEP_DURATION (default = 30min).
<br/><br/>
In the example shown to the left, "401: Unauthorized" may be the result of an incorrect API key or that you are attempting to use the One Call v3 API without the proper account setup.

<br clear="left"/>

### Time Server Error
<img src="showcase/demo-error-time.jpg" align="left" width="25%" />
This error screen appears when the esp32 fails to fetch the time from NTP_SERVER_1/NTP_SERVER_2. This error sometimes occurs immediately after uploading to the esp32; in this case, just hit the reset button or wait for SLEEP_DURATION (default = 30min) and the esp32 to automatically retry.
